How to compile and run:
	- Used VSCode as my text editor.
	- To run this program correctly, unzip the file that is sent to the submission dropbox and open all the files in VSCode.
	  Start by compiling and running the "FractalDrawer.java" file.  It should prompt the user to enter a shape that they would like to
	  make a fractal of...
	- Continue by entering the shape you would like.  Make sure to type either all lowercase, or only the first letter capitalized when
	  typing the shape.  IE: "rectangle" or "Rectangle"...
	- Once the shape has been entered, a canvas window should be created that contains the associated fractal.
	  BE AWARE THAT THERE IS A COMMON BUG OCCURIN WHERE THE CANVAS WINDOW MUST BE MINIMIZED TO SHOW THE WHOLE FRACTAL.  To fix this issue,
	  just click the minimize or maximize button on the canvas window and the whole fractal should appear.
	- Once the "FractalDrawer.java" file has been ran, it will also print out the total area of the fractal that was just made

Additional Features:
	- Added a new attribute for the class of each shape called "Color c" which made it considerably easier to set the color of a new object

Known bugs:
	- It makes no sense, but in order to successfully see the whole fractal that is made, the user must resize the window of the canvas...
	  so either click minimize or maximize to see the whole fractal

Sources:
	- From linuxhint.com: used "import static java.lang.Math.PI;" to represent PI as well as to utilize the math.pow function
	- From Canvas.java: acquired inspiration to utilize the color class witch extends the object class.
						I looked at Canvas to understand how the color class works and how to import it.
	- Stackoverflow: Utilized this to understand the random class and the process behind untilizing it to generate a radom color each time a fractal call is made


Honestly Pledge:
	- I certify that the information contained in this README
	file is complete and accurate. I have both read and followed the course policies
	in the ‘Academic Integrity - Course Policy’ section of the course syllabus.
